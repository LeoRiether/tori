### The frictionless music player for the terminal

tori is a terminal-based music player and playlist manager that can play music from local files
and external URLs (supported by yt-dlp).

## Features
- Plays songs from local files and external URLs
- Configurable keybinds
- Filters songs by name, artist or filepath/URL
- Sorts songs by name or duration
- Spectrum visualizer

## Alternatives
- [musikcube](https://github.com/clangen/musikcube) is what I used before writing tori.
  It's a great player, but only plays from local files.
