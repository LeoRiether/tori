# tori
## Terminal-based playlist player

## yt-dlp
If you want to use yt-dlp instead of youtube-dl, edit your `mpv.conf` and paste the following line:
```
script-opts=ytdl_hook-ytdl_path=yt-dlp
```

Either this or follow [the guide I followed :)](https://www.funkyspacemonkey.com/replace-youtube-dl-with-yt-dlp-how-to-make-mpv-work-with-yt-dlp)
